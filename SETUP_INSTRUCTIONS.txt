   ====VAGRANT VIRTUALIZED DEV ENVIRONMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS===

I. PURPOSE

 > To enable the use of a simulated production environment by all members of Tech team 
irrespective of their local dev environments
> To get as much a sense of what the project is going to look like in production by using the 
same setup during development
> To automate installation of need web stack packages, development tools and such others.



II. REQUIRED COMPONENTS/DOWNLOADS

To properly setup a development environment using Vagrant, we need two vital components:

1. VirtualBox: While there are many other providers out there, we will be using VirtualBox 
to manage our Linux virtual machines.

You may find more detailed information about VirtualBox at: https://www.virtualbox.org/

2. Vagrant: This is the tool that will enable us to create "lightweight, reproducible and portable
development environments" for our project. This way, irrespective of what you use for a local
dev machine (PC, Mac, some-other-system, etc.), we can all use, run and develop on the same 
setup as everyone else on the team. No more, "I couldn't get it to work on my machine", 
"but it worked on mine without hiccups" lunch time conversations.

Please, find more detailed information at: https://www.vagrantup.com/

III. THE SETUP

There are three (3) parts to the setup for it to work

1. HOST MACHINE SETUP:
 
> On your host machine (your PC, Mac, etc.) create a directory called, "imentor_project"
> cd into this directory (cd imentor_project)
Now, we will clone the 'platform' and 'vagrant_devserver' repositories. This will help us 
avoid having to manually-tweak the vagrant configuration file (Vagrantfile) and other 
parts of the vagrant setup process.

Make sure you have git properly configured at this point.
If you need a refresher on setting up Git and GitHub, please, see:
> Using Git: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/
> Using GitHub: https://help.github.com/

(Or reach out to other members of the team who can help.)

While inside the imentor_project directory, you will download the 'platform' codebase 
and custom vagrant_devserver repositories from GitHub as follows (and in this order):
> Download the 'platform' repository: 
   1. Type (or paste) in: git clone https://github.com/jallohm/vagrant_devserver.git 
   2. Change into the platform directory: 
   	Type in: cd platform

> Download the vagrant_devserver repo:
While still inside the 'platform/' directory:
   1. Type (or paste) in: git clone https://github.com/jallohm/vagrant_devserver.git
   2. Change into the vagrant_devserver directory

By your imentor_project folder should look like:
 imentor_project:
	platform
		vagrant_devserver 

In order words, you should now be in path/to/imentor_project/platform/vagrant_devserver

Now, we are ready to set up the Vagrant virtualized environment to work on the codebase 
and run the project server.

2. GUEST MACHINE (VIRTUALIZED LOCAL SERVER) SETUP
RUN the provison.sh script to automatically-execute these

> NOTE: This will be automatically-done for you. You may sit around and see what's going on though.
